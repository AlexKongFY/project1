## Game

A mind strategy board game for two players that consists of "Black" and "White". The game starts with 4 four discs on a 8 by 8 grid board. Each turn, the player has 4 possible options to choose to connect the same colored discs. The player who has the most number of colored discs (Black) against the opponent (White). He/she wins the game.

## Game Design

Understanding how the game before doing the code logic.

1. How the game completes?
2. No. players involved such as player vs player, player vs computer?
3. The size of the board and grids.
4. Directions how each discs is allowed to flip and rules?
5. Changing turns in each player?
6. Positions of the starting pieces to place for the game board before beginning the game?

## Approach and Process

Apply HTML, CSS and Javascript to build layout of the board game for easy reference.
Apply game rules into the Javascript coding logic.

## Challenges

1. Minimum playing games experience in design games.

2. Flipping the board pieces in 8 directions for similar pieces due to initial design is built by square id numbers. It will be better if rows and columns are defined inital design for easy reference on the flipping piece part.

3. Redesign the square grids of HTML & CSS with Javascript instead of starting hard code only HTML and CSS. It helps to get a idea how the game looks like?

4. If conditional statements and function logic mixed during game design flow and game controller design.
